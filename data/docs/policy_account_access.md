# Policy: Account Access and Login

Account access issues are handled through standard procedures, with escalation when necessary.

## Section 1 — Password Issues
- Customers should reset their password via the portal.  
- If the reset fails or the link does not work, escalate to a support manager.  

## Section 2 — Identity Verification
- Suspicious login activity requires identity verification.  
- If verification fails or appears fraudulent, escalate to a support manager.
