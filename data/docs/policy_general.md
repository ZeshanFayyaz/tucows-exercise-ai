# Policy: General Support Guidelines

Not all support requests align with a specific policy.

## Section 1 â€” Handling General or Vague Tickets
- If the ticket lacks sufficient detail, request additional information.  
- If the issue is clear and does not require escalation, respond directly and close the case.
